# FoodMine

FoodMine is a food database project from the Barabasi Lab of the Network Science Institute (Northeastern University). The objective of this project is to mine research litereature to uncover chemical contents in food. The code in this repository was used to generate the food pilots, plots, and other information in **FoodMine: Exploring Food Contents in Scientific Literature** (Hooton, Menichetti, Barab√°si). Additionally, we have included the data from out initial experiments.
