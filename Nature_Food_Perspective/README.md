Qualifying the incomplete view of food, [The Unmapped Complexity of our Diet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-019-0005-1) ([Menichetti](https://www.barabasilab.com/people/giulia-menichetti), [Barabási](barabasilab.com/people/laszlo-barabasi), [Loscalzo](http://researchfaculty.brighamandwomens.org/briprofile.aspx?id=1863)) details the current friction between currently available resources for the chemical content of food and future objectives. FoodMine is one of the reverences discussed in the publication, and FoodMine related code to calculate the overlap of health compounds in CTD is located in Perspective_Analysis.ipynb.

> The Unmapped Complexity of our Diet Abstract
> 
>Our understanding of how diet affects health is limited to 150 key nutritional components that are tracked and catalogued by the USDA and other national databases. Although this knowledge has been transformative for health sciences, helping unveil the role of calories, sugar, fat, vitamins and other nutritional factors in the emergence of common diseases, these nutritional components represent only a small fraction of the more than 26,000 distinct, definable biochemicals present in our food — many of which have documented effects on health but remain unquantified in any systematic fashion across different individual foods. Using new advances, such as machine learning, a high-resolution library of these biochemicals could enable the systematic study of the full biochemical spectrum of our diet, opening new avenues through which to understand the composition of what we eat, and how it affects health and disease.

> **Figure 1: Untracked biochemicals and their health implications.** Animal products contain L-carnitine, choline and choline-contributing compounds21. These molecules are metabolized by gut bacteria into trimethylamine (TMA), which is converted in the liver to trimethylamine-N-oxide17 (TMAO), a compound linked to coronary events16. Garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, and red wine, staple ingredients of the Mediterranean diet, reduce the production of TMAO through allicin and 3,3-dimethylbutan-1-o1 (DMB) that block TMA production by gut bacteria. Of the six biochemical compounds involved in this pathway, only one, choline, is tracked in food by the USDA. The other compounds are part of the Nutritional Dark Matter (in red).

> **Figure 2: Linking the Diet to the Genome and Disease.** Our daily eating patterns define a unique biochemical barcode, representing a high-resolution description of each person’s individual chemical exposure through his or her diet, or individual foodome. To assess in a reliable fashion the individual foodome we can take advantage of the smartphone revolution and collect daily food diaries59 via image capture. Combined with genomics and disease histories, access to this full biochemical palette could help us expand the widely used GWAS-based tools to account for the biochemical composition of our eating patterns, and systematically unveil the linkages between specific food biochemicals, genome variations, and health.
